# SpotifyMoodAnalyzer

## Change Scope of Project
Did not find an alternative for audio analysis, only getting the user's top songs and artists, use Gemini's existing knowledge for anaylsis. 

## Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to take a user's Spotify data in the short-term (4 weeks), medium-term (6 months), and long-term (12 months). Using that data, the AI will analyze and then report to the user about how their music habits have changed, whether they are happier or sadder, and other features. My inspiration started from Obscurify (https://www.obscurifymusic.com/), but instead of using different users, I want to use generative AI.

## Current Progress
Finetuning Gemini, read from the database to do comparisons based on past queries, integrate Last.FM data as well

## Example Output
Your top songs and artists reveal a blend of upbeat, celebratory vibes with a potential undercurrent of introspection and maybe even some sadness.

* **The Upbeat Side:**  Diljit Dosanjh features heavily, with several top tracks.  His music is often celebratory and energetic, suggesting times of joy, confidence, and possibly even a need for high energy and self-affirmation (indicated by repeated listening to his tracks).

* **The Introspective Side:** The presence of Coldplay (specifically "Man in the Moon") hints at moments of reflection and perhaps longing. This song carries a melancholy beauty which suggests there may have been periods of pensive contemplation and emotional depth. 

* **The Emotional Rollercoaster (Potential):**  Including artists like Halsey, Panic! At The Disco, and Fall Out Boy suggests that you enjoy exploring a range of emotional depth in music, sometimes leaning towards intense feelings, be it exhilaration, heartbreak, or angst. These are emotional groups whose music explores more nuanced or darker tones.


**Overall, my initial impression is that your mood has been quite varied over the last year. You seem to be someone who experiences a full range of emotions.** The heavy concentration on Diljit Dosanjh could imply periods of needing that self-confidence boost and high energy music more than other periods, but it also co-exists with more melancholic choices.


**Recommendations to enhance mood:**

It's impossible to give definite recommendations without further information. However, here are some general strategies based on my analysis:


1. **Mindfulness of Emotional Shifts:** Try to pay attention to *when* you listen to certain artists or genres. This could indicate your mood or something else you are struggling with during certain periods of the year. Do you reach for Diljit Dosanjh when you feel down? Coldplay when needing emotional catharsis?
2. **Diversification of Playlist:** Since your range of artists is so expansive, consider intentionally introducing genres or artists known for being calming or uplifting.   Maybe add some ambient electronic, Lo-fi hip hop or nature sounds for mindful listening during moments of stress or sadness, alongside what is currently being listened to. This balances out what has already been highlighted.
3. **Explore Instrumental Music:** This may particularly suit quiet reflection when needing time to sit and digest any negative emotions experienced through more heavy artists such as Halsey or Panic! At The Disco.

**Genre Recommendations based on what's identified:**

Considering your current listening habits, here are some genre suggestions to broaden your emotional palette while acknowledging your present preferences:

* **For Uplifting & Energetic Moods:**  Bhangra (if you enjoy the energetic side of Diljit Dosanjh),  Latin Pop (infectious rhythms and uplifting vibes).
* **For Introspective & Calm Moods:**  Indie Folk,  Neo-Soul, or even Classical Music (think Erik Satie).
* **For emotionally nuanced listening:**  Find indie pop and artists in similar lanes as the emotional side of artists currently listened to.  Listen to playlists of other artists associated with similar musicians (or ones discovered within similar taste recommendation platforms).  Explore different subgenres and playlists with similar aesthetics. 


This analysis is a starting point. Music is highly personal, and its effect varies based on your current emotional state and how a song personally resonates with you. If you are struggling with feelings of ongoing depression, then please consider seeking help with therapy or similar professionals.
