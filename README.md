# SpotifyMoodAnalyzer

## Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to take a user's Spotify data in the short-term (4 weeks), medium-term (6 months), and long-term (12 months). Using that data, find the averages of the song's features and hand that data over to an AI such as Gemini. The AI will analyze and then report to the user about how their music habits have changed, whether they are happier or sadder, and other features. My inspiration started from Obscurify (https://www.obscurifymusic.com/), but instead of using different users, I want to use AI.

## Current Progress
Integrated Gemini, working on finetuning and working on adding some more methods for more comparisons such as comparing between terms. Considering adding Apache Kafka and a database to store past user data and use that for more data.

## Example Output
**What the data shows:** Your top songs, combined with the overall averages for acousticness, energy, danceability, and valence (a measure of musical positiveness), paint a picture of someone experiencing a blend of melancholic and anxious feelings.

The high acousticness suggests a desire for introspection and perhaps some comfort in softer sounds. The lower energy and valence scores indicate a tendency towards calmer, potentially more subdued moods, potentially hinting at feelings of sadness or low energy.

The slightly elevated danceability suggests an attempt to maybe counteract these feelings, perhaps an unconscious desire for some release or distraction.  The relatively high liveness could be associated with excitement and immersion when listening to your chosen songs; however, the energy scores show a disconnect to this; leading to an explanation of having these emotional highs and lows.

Your average tempo sits comfortably in a moderate range. Neither especially fast or slow suggesting neither intense energy or extreme tiredness is consistently evident in the data provided.

The loudness is average (not exceptionally loud or quiet, and this again demonstrates moderation in feeling).  Finally the relatively high instrumentalness is more evidence towards contemplation and reflection, reflecting introspection found in higher acousticness ratings.

**Overall Impression:**  While there are some potentially distracting or lifting factors present, it seems as if sadness and anxiety may be overarching themes currently. You seem to be internally processing difficult or overwhelming emotions but find an underlying desire to elevate your mood and have some time to engage with more light hearted and happy things in your life, which might be counteracting what's reflected in the higher prevalence of slightly slower, more introspective tunes you like listening to.

**Suggestions for Mood Improvement:**

*   **Mindfulness and Self-Compassion:** Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your emotions without judgment. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply taking time each day to observe your feelings. It is crucial for mental health to treat yourself with compassion; acknowledging difficulties without self criticism.
*   **Physical Activity:** Even a short walk can do wonders for mood. Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
*   **Creative Expression:** Express your feelings creatively through writing, painting, drawing, or any other form of art that resonates with you.  This is a non-invasive therapy approach where expressing the inner self, in its whole raw reality, may help understand personal emotional status.

**Music Recommendations:**

Given your current musical preferences, it might be beneficial to gradually introduce more upbeat and energetic music into your playlist. However, keep some calm, reflective music too. You want to foster emotional wellbeing not forcibly override existing emotions with an overwhelming counter-reaction. However gradual improvement would benefit a healthier emotional baseline:

*   For uplifting moments, try some indie pop, mellow pop, funk and even some bright and uplifting electronic music
*   For the calmer reflective moments, I might suggest focusing on slightly higher energy acoustic and calming ambient and electronic music.

Remember, music is a powerful tool, and exploring different genres can contribute positively to your emotional wellbeing; it isn't a guaranteed solution, but it helps aid the improvement processes already started, along with the additional self-care therapies already introduced. Don't hesitate to seek support from a mental health professional if you are experiencing persistent sadness or anxiety.
