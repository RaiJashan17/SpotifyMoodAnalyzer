# SpotifyMoodAnalyzer

## Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to take a user's spotify data in the short-term (4 weeks), medium term (6 months), and long term (12 months). Using that data, find the averages of the songs features and hand that data over to an AI such as Gemini. The AI will analyze and then give a report to the user about how their music habits have changed, is it happier or sadder, and other features. My insipration started from Obscurify, but instead of using other users I want to use AI.

## Current Progress
Working on the backend of the project using Java and Springboot, consuming API requests from Spotify and storing that data. Also sending back song data to calculate the averages.
