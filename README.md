# SpotifyMoodAnalyzer

## Goal of Project
The goal of this project is to take a user's Spotify data in the short-term (4 weeks), medium-term (6 months), and long-term (12 months). Using that data, find the averages of the song's features and hand that data over to an AI such as Gemini. The AI will analyze and then report to the user about how their music habits have changed, whether they are happier or sadder, and other features. My inspiration started from Obscurify (https://www.obscurifymusic.com/), but instead of using different users, I want to use AI.

## Current Progress
Integrated Gemini, working on finetuning and working on adding some more methods for more comparisons. Considering adding Apache Kafka.
